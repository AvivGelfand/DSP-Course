## Modeling Method
Implemented the modeling method described in the following article:
* Z. Chen, J. Yu, Y. Zhu, Y. Chen and M. Li, "[D3: Abnormal driving behaviors detection and identification using smartphone sensors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7338354)," 2015 12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON), Seattle, WA, USA, 2015, pp. 524-532, doi: 10.1109/SAHCN.2015.7338354. keywords: {Sensors;Vehicles;Acceleration;Monitoring;Accelerometers;Turning;Weaving}.
* A risky driving behavior can be indicated by identifying one or more of the following driving behaviors using SVM or another ML algorithm.

## Data Set Candidates
* [Driving Behavior Kaggle Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/outofskills/driving-behavior/data) - The dataset is labeled into three classes: "slow," "normal", and "aggressive".
  The building is described in the paper: Cojocaru, Ion & Popescu, Paul. (2022). [Building a Driving Behaviour Dataset](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365629800_Building_a_Driving_Behaviour_Dataset). 101-107. 10.37789/rochi.2022.1.1.17.
