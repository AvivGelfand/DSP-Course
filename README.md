## Data Set Candidates
[Driving Behavior Kaggle Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/outofskills/driving-behavior/data) - The dataset is labeled in three classes: "slow", "normal" and
"aggressive", building is described in the paper: Cojocaru, Ion & Popescu, Paul. (2022). [Building a Driving Behaviour Dataset](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365629800_Building_a_Driving_Behaviour_Dataset). 101-107. 10.37789/rochi.2022.1.1.17.
